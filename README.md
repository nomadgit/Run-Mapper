Run-Mapper
=========================

Run Mapper is a project aimed at helping runners find running trails around them. In the future it hopes a become a social platform for runners with the ability to create running meetups and invite their friends.

Route creation uses Google Maps V3 API to allow users to plot routes, find route distance and create elevation profiles.
